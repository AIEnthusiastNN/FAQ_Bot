Here are five examples of cool potions from the story and what they do:\n\n1. Guaranteed ten-second pimple vanisher (pink pot): This potion works by making any zits or pimples disappear within ten seconds. It's excellent for treating boils, blackheads, and other skin issues.\n2. Polyjuice Potion (bottle): This potion allows the drinker to transform into anyone they desire. It's commonly used by the Weasley twins to change their appearance and pull pranks on their friends.\n3. Love Potion No. 9 (small vial): This potion is designed to make the person who drinks it fall deeply in love with the first person they see. However, it only lasts for a short period, so the\neffects may wear off quickly.\n4. Memory Potion (clear liquid): This potion can erase specific memories from someone's mind. It's often used by Professor Dumbledore to help his students forget traumatic events or protect them from\ndark magic.\n5. Invisibility Potion (golden elixir): As its name suggests, this potion makes the drinker invisible. It's commonly used by students to avoid getting caught while pulling pranks or sneaking around\nthe castle.\n\nSources: \n/kaggle/input/harry-potter-books-in-pdf-1-7/HP books/Harry Potter - Book 6 - The Half-Blood Prince.pdf \n/kaggle/input/harry-potter-books-in-pdf-1-7/HP books/Harry Potter - Book 6 - The Half-Blood Prince.pdf \n/kaggle/input/harry-potter-books-in-pdf-1-7/HP books/Harry Potter - Book 7 - The Deathly Hallows.pdf\n\nTime elapsed: 50 s\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Gradio Chat UI\n","\n","- Create a chat UI with [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/guides/quickstart)\n","- [ChatInterface docs](https://www.gradio.app/docs/chatinterface)\n","- The notebook should be running if you want to use the chat interface\n","- Print of the chat UI below"],"metadata":{"id":"dfbQUEc6bkfc"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["! pip install --upgrade gradio -qq"],"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-12T17:35:25.223976Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-12T17:35:25.224369Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-12T17:35:48.078022Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-12T17:35:25.224335Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-12T17:35:48.076731Z"},"trusted":true,"id":"PJzBiZeKbkfc","outputId":"fc61015e-ffd7-4ca9-f2b6-2902d7985ff1"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"huggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked, after parallelism has already been used.
